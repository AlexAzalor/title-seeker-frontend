It has scenes where the protagonist has endless ammo, and the thing is that such unrealistic mechanics are suitable for such titles, because you are mainly interested in the impression of the action scenes, but there are people who give bad ratings because of this detail.

The most important thing is that the funny/stupid element remains until the end of the film, and it is not eliminated. For example, Mr. Bean or the Pink Panther, who save the world in bizarre ways. That is, they did not become “normal” by the end of the film, but continued their “natural” life further. It is evaluated how much logic and comedy work together. And how funny the film was overall. Examples: Idiocracy, Don't Threaten South Central..., Jay and Silent Bob... Note: films like 9 Yards do not fit this criterion, because the comedy there is that an ordinary person gets involved in crime and starts behaving like a fool, but then gets used to it and therefore everything smoothly becomes normal for him (and for the viewer).",
