This category reflects the deeper ideas and structural features of the film. Important! Because there are an infinite number of films, the specification can (or should) be different for each.

Comparisons between similar details from other films and although this is generally not worth doing, but when someone sets a higher bar, you cannot deny it and you will automatically compare the performance of this character/actor (e.g. Joker) with the performance of others, etc."

      "description": "A film that has a comedic element from beginning to end, where funny acting is an element of the world, not ‚Äúfeigning for the sake of feigning.‚Äù The worldbuilding has a funny or caricature element. The characters exist with something that seems funny and stupid to us, but for them it is part of life. The most important thing is that the funny/stupid element remains until the end of the film, and it is not eliminated. For example, Mr. Bean or the Pink Panther, who save the world in bizarre ways. That is, they did not become ‚Äúnormal‚Äù by the end of the film, but continued their ‚Äúnatural‚Äù life further. It is evaluated how much logic and comedy work together. And how funny the film was overall. Examples: Idiocracy, Don't Threaten South Central..., Jay and Silent Bob... Note: films like 9 Yards do not fit this criterion, because the comedy there is that an ordinary person gets involved in crime and starts behaving like a fool, but then gets used to it and therefore everything smoothly becomes normal for him (and for the viewer)."
